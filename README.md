The printf project is a team project by Onuora Chidimma and Achebe Chika.
Completion of this project is a requirement for the successful graduation from ALX as a Software Engineer. In this project, we will create a function named "_printf" that imitates the built-in "printf" command as defined in the stdio.h library.
